# Human Activity Recognition Project

Welcome to the Human Activity Recognition project! In this repository, I've developed a Python-based classification system to identify various human activities using sensor data from smartphones. The goal is to accurately classify activities such as walking, sitting, and more.

## Dataset

The project utilizes the Human Activity Recognition database, consisting of recordings from participants carrying waist-mounted smartphones with embedded sensors. The dataset includes six activities: walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, and laying.

## Model

I've trained a machine learning model using Python to analyze accelerometer and gyroscope data. The model extracts meaningful features from sensor signals and uses them to classify different activities.

## Usage

To explore this project:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/shivanshu8211/Body-posture-classification.git`
2. Install required dependencies: python3, sklearn
3. Run the file: `main.ipynb`

Feel free to tweak parameters and experiment with the model to better understand its capabilities.
